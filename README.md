# [backend]

Express-powered backend for the [status-app] project made in TypeScript. Currently in a **prototype** development stage.

This is an early-stage project: it is only tested to work on a local host.

For now, a [SolidJS web application prototype][web-prototype] can be used as a preview of the final product.


## Initial setup

- Install [NodeJS 18][nodejs], and [pnpm] (`npm i -g pnpm`).

- Run `pnpm i` in the root project folder to install the dependencies using [pnpm].


## Running

Run `pnpm dev` in the root project folder, and follow the instructions in the terminal.
